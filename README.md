### How To Use?

__A Jar file(md_html_converter.jar)__ is a tool for Markdown Converter.
In this program, basically we call '.md' file, and decide conversion type, Output's name, Output's style, and Where we saves. Now, our steps of developing is not enough for showing all options. Basically we design converter **'.md' -> '.html'**


__1. When executing through ant build script :__

```
  a. Change location to ROOT directory using CMD, and check the existence of ‘build.xml’. 
  b. Compile java files using commands ‘ant’.
  c. Make jar file for running. Our ant command is ‘ant make_jar’
  d. Change directory for running file. We decided location of jar file in ‘lib’ directory. ‘cd lib.’
  e. Run jar file with right arguments that already defined. Our jar file’s name is md_html_converter.jar. 
  java -jar md_html.jar {input_file} [options]
  ex) java -jar md_html_converter.jar README.md
     java -jar md_html_converter.jar ../README.md -o result -f html -d ../ -s plain
     java -jar md_html_converter.jar -h
```   

__2. When executing through eclipse Java compiler__
  : Run with necessary arguments given for the options

{input_file}: Input file's name. You can add name extension ".md" or not. But this program only find '.md' File.
              If computer does not find input file, it will send error message.
              If you put only {input_file}, "{input_file}.html" file will be made (same name, but '.html').

[options]: 
        -o  (filename) : Make html file which name is <filename>.
                         We do not allow file's name extension. You can decide file's type(format) using '-f'
        -f  (format)   : Decide output's format type. Only '.html' is allowed in this version.
        -s  (style)    : Decide output's style type (plain, fancy, slide). Only 'lower case' is allowed in (style). 
                         If style is plain, '(filename).html' will be made, any others,
                        '(filename)_(style).html' will be made.
        -d  (direction): Decide where will you put the file. You can decide directory address.
                         End of address, you can add '\' or not. Both are allowed.
